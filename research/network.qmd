## Research network 

The lab is embedded in a strong international and interdisciplinary network. 

- We collaborate with other research labs within the Department of Experimental Psychology and the Department of Biology. 

- For the long-term Methusalem program (2021-2027; renewable), we work very closely together with Prof. Dr. An Martel (Division of Poultry, Exotic Companion, Wildlife and Laboratory Animals at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of UGent). 

 - In addition, the lab can rely on a large multidisciplinary network of international collaborators to provide theoretical and technical input and to discuss the (theoretical and practical) implications of our findings. 
 
 - Lab members are encouraged and supported to expand their own research network. In general, Dr Lens and Dr Verbruggen are happy to involve external researchers in ECoBird research projects. Lab members wishing to involve other researchers in their projects (while working in the ECoBird lab) should also discuss this with the PIs.
