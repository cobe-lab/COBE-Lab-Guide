## Research support

- Lab members can get research support from dedicated staff within the lab, the department, faculty, and at the central UGent level (e.g, the [data steward team](https://www.ugent.be/en/research/datamanagement/support/data-stewards.htm) for support with RDM requirements). 

- At a lab level, there is a dedicated person responsible for all animal-care related issues at the Wild Life Rescue center. For more general WRC-related issues, Reinoud Allaert will provide additional support. In the past, we have had issues where animal care requests were coming from multiple members of our lab, which was not being sufficiently mindful of time and busy schedules of the support staff. Therefore, in general, you should not directly
contact the lab's support staff with discussing the request first with Dr. Lens and/or Dr. Verbruggen. See also the ['communication'](/environment/communication.qmd) section for further guidelines. 

- Our lab is embedded in the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.ugent.be/pp/experimentele-psychologie/en) and the [Terrestrial Ecology Unit of the Department of Biology](https://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/). Both departments provide formal and informal support on many levels. In general, administrative requests can be addressed directly to Lies Baten (Psychology) or Angelica Alcantara (Biology); technical (computer) requests in Psychology should be addressed to Christophe Blankaert; and teaching/grading requests in Psychology should be addressed to Vicent Hoofs (see the department website for contact details). New requests for substantive support are best discussed first with Dr Lens and/or Dr Verbruggen (see also previous point).

- There are also departmental channels (Slack, Teams), which can be useful for informal support requests as well (ranging from research-related questions to questions related to living in Ghent/Belgium etc.). 

- The Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences provides all sorts of reseasrch support (e.g., statistical support, technical support, ...). More information and contact details can be found on the webpage of the [Research Support Office](https://www.ugent.be/pp/en/faculty-offices/rso).
