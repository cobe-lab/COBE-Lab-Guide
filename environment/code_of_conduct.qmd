## Code of conduct

All lab members and guests are expected to adhere to the lab's code of conduct. In addition, all lab members are required to adhere to the [Ghent University code of conduct on boundary-crossing behaviour](https://codex.ugent.be/?regid=REG000110&lang=en).

If you wish to speak with someone outside of the lab regarding an
incident that occurred in or outside of the lab, you can contact [Trustpunt](https://www.ugent.be/intranet/en/human-resources/health-safety/psychosocial-welfare/overview.htm) 
or an ombudsperson within the faculty or university.

### Statement of intent

Our lab is dedicated to providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. We do not
tolerate harassment for any form of identity such as but not limited
to: sex, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability
including mental illness, physical appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, religion (including the lack thereof), or socioeconomic
status. We do not tolerate harassment of lab members or guests in
any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any lab
event or venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and
other online media.

### Details of Lab Code of Conduct

- There are different forms of behaviour that cross personal boundaries:

  1. Violence: physical or psychological threats or attacks at work.

  2. Bullying: repeated behaviour – language, threats, actions, gestures, texts, ignoring, etc. – that is hostile, insulting or offensive. It undermines the person’s character, dignity or (psychological or physical) integrity, or endangers their job.

  3. Sexual harassment: any form of verbal, non-verbal or physical behaviour with a sexual connotation that undermines a person’s dignity or is threatening, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive.

  4. Discrimination: a person who is treated unequally based on personal characteristics (such as origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, skin colour, religion, beliefs, disability, etc.)

We do not tolerate such behaviors in any way or form. 

-  We expect lab members to
    follow our code of conduct at conferences and workshops and related
    social events, and whenever they are representing the lab in a
    professional context.
-  When lab members are invited
    to participate in a professional event, they are expected to inquire
    regarding the steps that the organizers are taking to ensure
    diversity prior to accepting any invitation. This includes declining
    participation in exclusionary events such as panels or talks. For
    example, men in the lab should avoid participating in all-men panels
    whenever possible, keeping in mind that this may be more achievable
    for senior versus junior lab members.

### Responding to incidents

Some boundaries are clear and leave no room for discussion. However, others depend on a personal case-by-case basis. What someone else may (still) think is normal, you might actually experience as crossing a boundary. Do you feel like someone is crossing your boundaries?

  - Clearly indicate where your boundaries lie and ask the other person to respect them. Lab members asked to stop any
    misconduct are expected to comply immediately. 
    
  - If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
    concerns, please contact Dr. Lens or Dr. Verbruggen as soon as possible.
