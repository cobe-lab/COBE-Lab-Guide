## Lab meetings

-  All researchers in the lab are expected to attend the bi-weekly lab meetings, except in cases of
    unavoidable conflict. The meetings generally last 1-2 hours. 
-  At the beginning of each meeting, all the members are invited to share the main activities of the
    past two weeks. 
-  This progress overview is followed by an activity, such as a presentation of research projects or data; a talk by an external
    speaker; or a discussion of specific research papers. 
-  For each meeting, another lab member will be in charge of organizing such an activity. Lab members can decide whether they want to present something themselves or invite others. 
- The lab meeting schedule (time, place, organizers) will be determined at the beginning of the term. 
- To further encourage cohesion within our diverse team, lab members are strongly encouraged to work from our main office on the day of the lab meeting. 
-  In addition to the regular (research-based) lab meetings, we also aim to organize at least one 'social event' for the whole lab per term.
