## Working remotely

-  We support the needs of lab members who must work remotely.   
-  Any remote work must be first discussed with the PIs. 
- Following this discussion, telework requests can be formalised in a telework charter, in accordance with [UGent's policies](https://www.ugent.be/intranet/en/workplace-buildings/teleworking/teleworkrequest.htm)


More information about UGent's telework framework can be found on the [intranet](https://www.ugent.be/intranet/en/workplace-buildings/teleworking).
