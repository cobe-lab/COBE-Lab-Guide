Our research approach is strongly interdisciplinary, at theoretical and methodological level.\nOur center is embedded in the Faculty of Psychology and the Faculty of Sciences (biology & ecology), and we closely collaborate with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Furthermore, we have interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers at other national and international universities, the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO Vlaanderen), and with the Wildlife Rescue Centre Ostend, where our avian research facilities are located.\nThe center also aims to be at the forefront of good research practices and Open Science. Where possible and useful, we preregister confirmatory studies and analysis protocols, and share the raw data, code, and experimental materials. Furthermore, we have established a ‘co-pilot system’, whereby members of the research team check e.g., each other’s code or rerun (parts of) the analysis. We hope that these practices can further promote transparency, openness, reproducibility, and scientific integrity.",

The meetings generally last 1-2 hours.\nAt the beginning of each meeting, all the members are invited to share the main activities of the past two weeks.\nThis progress overview is followed by an activity, such as a presentation of research projects or data; a talk by an external speaker; or a discussion of specific research papers.\nFor each meeting, another lab member will be in charge of organizing such an activity. Lab members can decide whether they want to present something themselves or invite others.\nThe lab meeting schedule (time, place, organizers) will be determined at the beginning of the term.\nTo further encourage cohesion within our diverse team, lab members are strongly encouraged to work from our main office on the day of the lab meeting.\nIn addition to the regular (research-based) lab meetings, we also aim to organize at least one ‘social event’ for the whole lab per term.",

    "text": "Addressing errors\nObviously, we aim to minimize errors (e.g., by implementing a ‘co-pilot system’). Still, errors can happen. When such errors are spotted, open and honest communication will occur and we will immediately take the appropriate steps to correct them:\n\nIf we identify an error in a published paper from the lab, all authors should convene promptly to discuss what if any conclusions are affected by the error.\nMost journals have a mechanism for either publishing a correction to the article when the primary conclusions of the paper are not substantially affected, or retracting the article if they are. All authors should agree on whether a correction or retraction is warranted, and promptly notify the journal of their recommendation and the nature of the error.\nIf applicable, a notification and corrected version of the article should also be submitted to the preprint server (e.g., bioRxiv or psyaRxiv), and internal copies of the paper should be corrected and versioned accordingly.\n\nThus, even tough we realise that committing errors can occur, dealing with them can be difficult (also at a personal level). The lab is therefore committed to creating a psychologically safe environment in which people can admit when mistakes have been made.",
